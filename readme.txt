Project Overview

Your project is a microservices-based architecture that utilizes Spring Cloud components to create a scalable and efficient system. The system consists of multiple services, each responsible for a specific functionality, such as Quiz Services, Questions Services, Result Services, and Report Services. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. API Gateway: This component acts as the single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices, such as the Quiz Services, Questions Services, Result Services, and Report Services. The API Gateway helps in managing cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.

2. Microservices:
   - Quiz Services: Handles operations related to quizzes, including creating and managing quizzes.
   - Questions Services: Manages questions for the quizzes.
   - Result Services: Responsible for processing and storing quiz results.
   - Report Services: Generates reports based on quiz results.

3. Service Registry (Eureka Server): This component is responsible for registering and discovering microservices. Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server, allowing the API Gateway and other services to discover and communicate with them dynamically.

4. OpenFeign Clients: These are used to simplify the communication between microservices. OpenFeign provides a declarative REST client that allows services to interact with each other via HTTP calls.

5. Database: MySQL Workbench is used for managing the databases that store data for various microservices.

6. Additional Components:
   - Spring Cloud LoadBalancer: Provides client-side load balancing for distributing requests across multiple instances of a microservice.
   - Spring Cloud Gateway: Used for routing and filtering requests in the API Gateway.

Additional Information
- Components Not Implemented: Although the diagram shows Sleuth & Zipkin for distributed tracing and a Configuration Server for managing externalized configuration, these components have not yet been implemented in your project.

This setup allows for scalability, easy management of microservices, and efficient handling of requests through the API Gateway, with dynamic service discovery and communication facilitated by Eureka and OpenFeign.
